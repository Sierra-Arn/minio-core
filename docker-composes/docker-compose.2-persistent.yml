      # Mounting volume for persistent MinIO object storage data
      # MinIO stores all object data, metadata, and configuration in the /data directory
      # Objects are immediately written to disk upon successful upload completion
      #
      # There are two approaches to persist MinIO data:
      # (Both approaches ensure data persists across container restarts and removals)
      # =====================================================
      # Option 1: Bind Mount (currently active)
      # Maps a host directory directly to the container's /data directory
      # Data is stored at the path specified by MINIO_DATA_PATH on the host machine
      # Provides direct access to files from the host filesystem
      - ../${MINIO_DATA_PATH}:/data
      # =====================================================
      # Option 2: Named Volume (alternative approach)
      # Uses Docker-managed storage with a named volume for better isolation and portability
      # Docker manages the storage location (typically /var/lib/docker/volumes/) instead of
      # using a direct path on the host filesystem
      # This is NOT a bind mount - Docker controls where and how data is stored
      # 
      # To use this approach:
      # 1. Comment out the bind mount line above
      # 2. Uncomment the volumes section at the bottom of this file
      # 3. Uncomment the line below
      # - minio-data:/data
      # =====================================================

# =====================================================
# Volumes Configuration
# Uncomment this section if using named volumes instead of bind mounts

#     # Using local driver to store data on the host machine
#     driver: local
#     # Data will persist even after container removal
#     # On docker-compose restart, data will be restored automatically
