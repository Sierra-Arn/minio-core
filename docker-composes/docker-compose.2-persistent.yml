      # Mounting volume for persistent MinIO object storage data
      # Volume minio-data will be created automatically on first run
      # MinIO stores all object data, metadata, and configuration in the /data directory
      # Objects are immediately written to disk upon successful upload completion
      #
      # There are two approaches to persist MinIO data:
      # (Both approaches ensure data persists across container restarts and removals)
      # =====================================================
      # Option 1: Bind Mount (currently active)
      # Maps a host directory directly to the container's /data directory
      # Data is stored at the path specified by MINIO_DATA_PATH on the host machine
      # Provides direct access to files from the host filesystem
      - ${MINIO_DATA_PATH}:/data
      # =====================================================
      # Option 2: Named Volume (alternative approach)
      # Uses Docker-managed storage with a named volume
      # Comment out the bind mount above and uncomment the volumes section 
      # at the bottom of this file to use this approach
      # =====================================================
